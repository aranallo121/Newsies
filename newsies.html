          <h3>Raleigh Man Fed Up After House Hit By Car For 6th Time</h3>
            <hr class="in_article">
            <p>
                RALEIGH (WTVD) -- Carlo Bernarte is on the verge of abandoning his home to save his family. Early Saturday morning, his property in Raleigh was hit by a driver for the 6th time.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm numb," said Bernarte as he walked through the damage. "The people who have the power to help me in my situation, I don't think, I'm not a priority to them."
            </p>
            <p>
                If this story sounds familiar, you may remember Bernarte's story from October 2015. That's when ABC11 reported that a drunk driver hit his home and later died at the hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bernarte actually kept the cross of flowers that marks the loss. But early Saturday morning, a sixth driver plowed through the cross, the entrance wall to the neighborhood, and right through Bernarte's property, sending trees to the ground and rocks through the wall and windows.
                <br>
                "All the particles from the wall, came crashing through my window," said Bernarte.
                <br>
                Raleigh police confirm the crash happened at 4:51 a.m. but as of Sunday night, they have not confirmed the details of what led up to the crash.

               Dan Carley had the world on a string of luck.
                <br>
                He was flush with cash and youth, engaged to the mother of his future child and riding the high of a $5-million lotto win.
                <br>
                Soon that would all come crashing down.
                <br>
                The 35-year-old father spoke exclusively with the Star from behind bars this week — during two conference calls with his longtime lawyer, Brenda Sandulak — just days after he was sentenced to two and a half years in a federal penitentiary for cocaine trafficking.
                <br>
                During the calls, Carley spoke of the high of winning the largest instant cash prize in provincial history at the time, a high that was followed by a decade-long spiral into addiction, bad investments and a suicide attempt.
                <br>
                Carley scratched his golden ticket at a St. Catharines convenience store on Feb. 21, 2006. He said he couldn’t have felt freer, celebrating the “surreal” windfall the next day with friends and family until 4 a.m. at Carley’s Pub, which he co-owned with his father.
                <br>
                He never really stopped.
                <br>
                “Things were pretty crazy,” he said. “I was drinking every single day, partying every single day, doing coke,” a drug he had only dabbled in before.
                <br>
                Carley estimates that more than one-fifth of his prize cash went to feed his growing addiction to cocaine, oxycodone and heroin over the next nine years.
                <br>
                “At least a million — maybe more,” he said. “You’re not really thinking about it, you’ve got lots of money in the bank, you just keep spending.”
                <br>
                Within seven months of hitting the jackpot, Carley said he’d sunk about $1.5 million into a “badly thought-out” plan to develop a string of Niagara bars that fizzled by 2007.

            <h3>Diaper-wearing monkey gets loose, scuffles with Wal-Mart employee in parking lot</h3>

            <h5>POSTED 7:42 PM, AUGUST 15, 2016, BY <a href ="http://wtvr.com/contact/">TRIBUNE MEDIA WIRE</a></h5>
            <p> 
               LANCASTER, Ohio-A pet monkey got loose in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Lancaster, Ohio Sunday night after apparently escaping from a recreational vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Video taken by <b>Richelle Stewart</b> shows a store employee trying to corral the diaper-wearing primate near the shopping cart return area.

                <p>
                    When the man gets close, however, the monkey can be seen jumping from the metal railing and grabbing him by the arm and clothing. A woman runs up to the employee yelling, "Let him go, let him go, let
                    him go! If he bites you, they will put him down."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The woman grabs the monkey by the hand and walks to an RV parked in the lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 911 caller told the emergency operator that the Wal-Mart worker had been bitten, but Lancaster police later determined that the animal had only grabbed the man, and that he was unharmed. Since he wasn’t hurt, no report was filed, according to police.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Department of Agriculture is trying to identify the woman to find out of the monkey has been registered in Ohio, according to <a href="http://ksn.com/2016/08/15/monkey-gets-loose-in-walmart-parking-lot/">KSNW-TV</a>.

            <h3>Panda Express may introduce new hybrid utensil - The "Chork"</h3>
                <hr class ="in_article">
            <h5>Published August 12, 2016</h5>

                Though hardly representative of authentic Chinese cuisine, General Tso's Chicken is one of the most popular dishes on Chinese restaurant menus in the U.S.  
                <br>
                So it may come as a shock that Panda Express, which bills itself as "American Chinese food," has never offered the flash-fried, slightly sweet and tangy chicken dish. Until now.
                <br>
                Earlier this week, the chain revealed that it will start offering General Tso’s from now through Dec. 27. According to Panda Express, its version of General Tso’s is “made with all-white meat chicken, red and yellow bell peppers, onions and string beans” and is spicier than its biggest seller-- orange chicken.
                <br>
                Many on Twitter were shocked that the restaurant had never actually sold the popular dish until now.
                <br>
                But Panda Express could be taking the concept of hybridization to the next level with a game-changing utensil—the “Chork.”
                <br>
                On Wednesday, Lisa Jennings, the West Coast bureau chief of Nation's Restaurant News, tweeted out that the fast food Chinese chain is “considering a move toward the “chork,” or the chopsticks/fork:”
